7. Reverse Integer
Reverse digits of an integer.
    Example1: x = 123, return 321
    Example2: x = -123, return -321

  |  Have you thought about this?
  |  Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
  |
  |  If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
  |
  |  Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? 
  |  Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
  |
  |  For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
  |__
Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
